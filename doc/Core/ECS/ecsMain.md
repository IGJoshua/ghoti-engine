# Entity Component System

The Entity Component System allows us to have more flexibility with Lua than some other design patterns would. Each Entity has one or more component that all have specific behaviors. Some components include the Entity's transform, model, the scene's camera, and various others.  
A list of already available components can be found [here]()
